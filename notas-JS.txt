JavaScript Functions and Events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
