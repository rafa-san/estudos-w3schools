JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

Example:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";

JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

. Fixed values
. Variable values

> Fixed values are called Literals.

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes

> Variable values are called Variables.


***


A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

. Arithmetic Operators
. Assignment Operators
. Comparison Operators
. String Operators
. Logical Operators
. Bitwise Operators
. Ternary Operators
. Type Operators


***

JavaScript Functions and Events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.


***


JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

Arithmetic Operators
. Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers

Assignment Operators
. Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables

Comparison Operators
String Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Ternary Operators
Type Operators

JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
String
Number
Bigint
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Symbol
Object

In JavaScript, Objects are King.
If you Understand Objects, you Understand JavaScript.
Objects are containers for Properties and Methods.

Properties are named Values.

Methods are Functions stored as Properties.

Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects.

.

JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

3.14 is a primitive value

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

string
number
boolean
null
undefined
symbol
bigint
